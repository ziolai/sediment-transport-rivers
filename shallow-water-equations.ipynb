    "Starting from 3D laminar time-dependent Navier-Stokes (conservation of mass and momentum) arrive at depth integrated Navier-Stokes model. Integrate conservation of mass and momentum from bottom where $z=0$ to surface where $z = \\xi(x,y,t)$. From conservation of mass, obtain $\\int_{z=0}^{z=\\xi} \\nabla {\\mathbf v} \\, dz$. Use the boundary conditions no-slip at $z=0$, the kinematic boundary conditions that particle remains attached at the water surface at $z = \\xi(x,y,t)$ and the fact that $\\dot{z} = w(x,y,z,t)$. Use Leibniz formula integral of a derivative. Do similar for convervation of momentum. Finally obtain three conservation equations for longitudinal velocity component $u(x,y,t)$, transversal velocity component $v(x,y,t)$ and water height $h(x,y,t)$). \n",

Might be hard for students to work with). (are periodic bc avialable?) (can sediment transport (equation for C in Chapter 5 of [1]) be added as additional transport equation?) \n",
    "- The package [FourierFlows.jl](https://fourierflows.github.io/FourierFlowsDocumentation/stable/literated/OneDShallowWaterGeostrophicAdjustment/) solves the shallow water equations supplied with periodic boundary conditions using Fourier pseudo-spectral methods (possibly too sophisticated for this project); \n",
    "- Dedicated shallow water solver: [ShallowWaters.jl](https://github.com/milankl/ShallowWaters.jl) (still supported?) (can sediment transport (equation for C in Chapter 5 of [1]) be added as additional transport equation?)  \n",
    "- As example in [ApproxFun.jl](https://github.com/JuliaApproximation/ApproxFun.jl/blob/master/examples/system_of_eqn.jl)? Provides algebra of operators. Possibly interesting to derive systems of coupled ODEs automatically. Systems of PDEs available in test version. Stable discretization not readily available? "
