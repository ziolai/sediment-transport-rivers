    "Model derivation for the shallow water equations. Starting from 3D laminar time-dependent Navier-Stokes (conservation of mass and momentum) arrive at depth integrated Navier-Stokes model. Integrate conservation of mass and momentum from bottom where $z=0$ to surface where $z = \\xi(x,y,t)$. From conservation of mass, obtain $\\int_{z=0}^{z=\\xi} \\nabla {\\mathbh v} \\, dz$. Use the boundary conditions no-slip at $z=0$, the kinematic boundary conditions that particle remains attached at the water surface at $z = \\xi(x,y,t)$ and the fact that $\\dot{z} = w(x,y,z,t)$. Use Leibniz formula integral of a derivative. Do similar for convervation of momentum. Finally obtain three conservation equations for longitudinal velocity component $u(x,y,t)$, transversal velocity component $v(x,y,t)$ and water height $h(x,y,t)$). \n",
