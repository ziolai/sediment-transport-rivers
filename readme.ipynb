    "## Section 1: Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "Describe computational challenges in modeling tidal flow and sediment transport in rivers. Refer to previous work to introduce context, previous milestones and future directions on research.  \n",

    "## Section 2: Models for Tidal Flow and Sediment Transport in Rivers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Goals \n",
    "\n",
    "Shallow water equations describe non-linear propagation of water waves. When exicited periodically (e.g. by tidal motion at the inlet of the channel), the non-linear nature of the equations will deform (modulate) the amplitude and frequency of the driving system. After sufficiently long time, the signal will become periodic again. The goal of the project is to compute the amplitude and frequency contents of this resulting periodic signal. (A demo using scalar wave equation with non-linear damping (with animation of both the excitation and the solution with both non-linear damping or non-linear stiffness) would be good to have here).   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Same Project Goals Reformulated \n",
    "\n",
    "- numerics: The shallow water equations (or any wave equation) with time-harmonic excitation can be solved by the classical approach in which discretization in space is followed by discretization in time. This approach, however, is possibly too time-consuming in case that time-periodic solutions are sought for. Alternative solution methods are called for;  \n",
    "- computer implementation: classical approach resort to sparse linear algebra that is hard to accelerate on GPU\n",
    "- harmonic balance method: takes periodicity into account from the start and can be implementated using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) that are blazingly fast on GPU. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Model derivation for the shallow water equations\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from 3D laminar time-dependent Navier-Stokes (conservation of mass and momentum) arrive at depth integrated Navier-Stokes model. Integrate conservation of mass and momentum from bottom where $z=0$ to surface where $z = \\xi(x,y,t)$. From conservation of mass, obtain $\\int_{z=0}^{z=\\xi} \\nabla {\\mathbf v} \\, dz$. Use the boundary conditions no-slip at $z=0$, the kinematic boundary conditions that particle remains attached at the water surface at $z = \\xi(x,y,t)$ and the fact that $\\dot{z} = w(x,y,z,t)$. Use Leibniz formula integral of a derivative. Do similar for convervation of momentum. Finally obtain three conservation equations for longitudinal velocity component $u(x,y,t)$, transversal velocity component $v(x,y,t)$ and water height $h(x,y,t)$). \n",
