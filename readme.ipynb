    "## Section 1: Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims at contributing to the computational modeling of [tidal flows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide#Current) and [sediment transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sediment_transport) in rivers. The flow of water in rivers can be described by the [shallow water equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shallow_water_equations) (linear vs. non-linear variant, laminar vs. turbulent model). When exicited periodically (e.g. by tidal motion at the inlet of the channel), the non-linear nature of the equations will deform (modulate) the amplitude and frequency of the driving system. After sufficiently long time, the signal will become periodic again. Both time-integration (after spatial discretization or method of lines) and harmonic balance methods (either after spatial or temporal discretization) will be explored. See the Section entitled Analysis in [wikipedia page on tidal flows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide#Current) for a motivation of harmonic balance method in the context of this project. \n",
    "\n",
    "The <b>goals</b> of the project include \n",
    "1. to solve the shallow water equations using a blend of analytical and numerical methods;   \n",
    "2. to compute the amplitude and temporal frequency content of the computed axial and transversal velocity components and the water height;\n",
    "3. to discover patterns in the sediment formation and study the stability of these patterns (via bifurcation analysis).\n",
    "\n",
    "The <b>use of the Julia programming language</b> is an integral part of the learning objectives of this project. Non-linear terms play an essential role in modifying the temporal frequency content of waves as they propagate. The analysis of these non-linear terms requires the computation of the Jacobian, independent of whether a transient time-stepping or harmonic balance method is used. Functions to compute these Jacobians in Python do exist. These functions, however, are either computationally costly (in case that finite difference quotients are used) or non-trivial to use (in case that automatic differentiation in a library like e.g. [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html) is used). Switching to Julia alleviates these bottlenecks. \n",

    "## Section 2: Project Levels \n",

    "\n",
    "Here we lump the body of water to a single point-mass or a system of multiple point masses. We assume this body to be subject to periodic forcing (alternating low and high tide) and friction (due to e.g. contact with river bed). The effect of non-linear springs and non-linear dampers on the motion of the mass subject to periodic forcing will be explored. The goal of this level to introduce key concepts, analysis tools and software techniques in the project.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here we describe water wave as transversal or longitudinal wave propagation in spring or membrane excited by periodic forcing. The physics of the change of water height is neglected. For the numerical solutions, we first discretize the eqiuations in space and subequently solve the resulting system of ordinary differential equations using a time-integration method. We thus apply the method of lines to solve the partial differential equation numerically. For simplicity, we apply for spatial discretization the finite difference method on a uniform mesh. The effect of the non-linearity on the temporal frequency content of the solution will again be explored. \n",
