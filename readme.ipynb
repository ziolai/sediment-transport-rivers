    "## Section 1: Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims at contributing to the computational modeling of [tidal flows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide#Current) and [sediment transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sediment_transport) in rivers. The flow of water in rivers can be described by the [shallow water equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shallow_water_equations) (linear vs. non-linear variant, laminar vs. turbulent model). When exicited periodically (e.g. by tidal motion at the inlet of the channel), the non-linear nature of the equations will deform (modulate) the amplitude and frequency of the driving system. After sufficiently long time, the signal will become periodic again. Both time-integration (after spatial discretization or method of lines) and harmonic balance methods (either after spatial or temporal discretization) will be explored. See the Section entitled Analysis in [wikipedia page on tidal flows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide#Current) for a motivation of harmonic balance method in the context of this project. \n",
    "\n",
    "The <b>goals</b> of the project include \n",
    "1. to solve the shallow water equations using a blend of analytical and numerical methods;   \n",
    "2. to compute the amplitude and temporal frequency content of the computed axial and transversal velocity components and the water height;\n",
    "3. to discover patterns in the sediment formation and study the stability of these patterns (via bifurcation analysis).\n",
    "\n",
    "The <b>use of the Julia programming language</b> is an integral part of the learning objectives of this project. Non-linear terms play an essential role in modifying the temporal frequency content of waves as they propagate. The analysis of these non-linear terms requires the computation of the Jacobian, independent of whether a transient time-stepping or harmonic balance method is used. Functions to compute these Jacobians in Python do exist. These functions, however, are either computationally costly (in case that finite difference quotients are used) or non-trivial to use (in case that automatic differentiation in a library like e.g. [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html) is used). Switching to Julia alleviates these bottlenecks. \n",

    "\n",
    "Throughout we project, we make the following four <b>important</b> assumptions: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. <b>periodic forcing</b>: the motion of water in the channel is caused by tital currents at the inlet of the channel. This scenario is thus similar to a wavepool. For simplicity, we assume a sinusoidal excitation at single frequency driving frequency $\\omega_d$ appears. The single frequency assumption is merely a mild assumption, as more general periodic excitation can be decomposed into set of frequencies by a Fourier decomposition.\n",
    "2. <b>damping</b>: the motion of water is described by a the wave equation that contains damping (typically friction of the water with the river bed). This damping causes initial transient in the solution to disappear in time. A steady-state solution that depends on the driving frequency $\\omega_d$ appears; \n",
    "3. <b>non-linearity</b>: the wave equation contains non-linear transport and/or friction terms. This non-linearity causes the frequency of the driving force to be modulated. The solution contains more than one frequency, even if the driving frequency varries at a single frequency. Consider $\\sin^3(x)$ as an example. We assume that the non-lineary is polynomial (in position, velocity or both). More general non-linearities can be accomodated via Taylor approximations;   \n",
    "4. <b>parametric</b>: the wave equation contains parameters such as the amplitude of the forcing or the amplitude of the polynomial non-linear terms. We are intered in how the solution depends on these parameters.\n",

    "### Section 1.6: Beginner Level: Scalar Wave Equation with Cubic Damping for a String \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we only consider the channel of water to be long and narrow. This allows to describe the channel along the $x$-direction (in the direction of the flow) only. To simplify concepts, we replace the water flow in a channel by the vibration of a long string or the propagation of a sound wave. The wave propagation is supposed to be driven by a periodic external forcing (spatial support of the external forcing remains to be specified). We furthermore include linear damping (and thus the disappearance of the homogeneous solution over time) and non-linear damping (and thus the apperance of higher order harmonics). The non-linearity introduced here serves as an illustration. Other non-linearities will be introduced later.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Goals</b> The goal of the beginner level is to solve non-linear wave equations (scalar only or include vectorial as well?) in one spatial dimensions. More specifically, the goals are to: \n",
    "1. solve the (un)damped <b>linear</b> wave equation with periodic forcing using analytical methods, the harmonic balance method and the method of lines (first discretize in space, then perform time integration). As analytical method, the method of seperation of variables (standing wave solution) or the method of characteristics (traveling wave solution) can be used. To take the non-homogeneous periodic forcing term into account analytically, [Duhamel's_principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duhamel's_principle) (convolution with Green's function, see also section on  Duhamels's principle in [wave equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_equation)) can be used. The availability of the analytical (closed form) solution allows to verify the accurary of the time stepping (discretization error in space and time) and harmonic balance solutions (truncation error in frequency domain). The solutions can be compared in frequency domain after taking the Fourier transform. In the linear case, the harmonic balance solution should match the analytical and numerical solution after sufficiently long time time required for initial transients to disappear from the solution. Profiling tools should allow to compare requirements of the harmonic balance and transient in terms of memory and CPU requirements; \n",
    "2. solve the damped <b>non-linear</b> wave equation with periodic forcing using the harmonic balance method and the method of lines and repeat the previous analysis to the extend possible;\n",
    "3. study how the solution depends of parameters (e.g. driving frequency (resonance) and amplitude of the damping force); \n",

    "<b>Problem Description</b> Let $x \\in \\Omega=(0,1)$ (in units m) denote the spatial domain. We here assume the string to have unit length. Let $t \\in [0,T]$ (in units s) denote the time interval. Let $u(x,t)$ (in units m) denote the displacement of the string (position relative to equilibrium position) (see later for shallow water equation models in which $u(x,t)$ represents the velocity). Let $\\partial u(x,t) / \\partial t = \\dot{u}(x,t)$ (in units m/s) denote the velocity of string. Let $c>0$ (in units m/s) denote the velocity of wave propagation. We assume that the motion of the string is subject to both friction force $F_{\\gamma}$ and driving (external force) $F_d$ (both per unit mass, in units N/kg). We assume that the friction force depends on velocity $\\dot{u}(x,t)$ only, i.e., $F_{\\gamma} = F_{\\gamma}[\\dot{u}(x,t)]$.

This term is responsible for the damping of transients (i.e., the homogeneous part of the solution). Without the linear $\\gamma$-term the harmonic balance method has no range of validity. The cubic $\\gamma_3$-term is a positive correction to the $\\gamma$-term that increases the friction force. The magnitude of the $\\gamma_3$-term is large compared to $\\gamma$-term only if $\\dot{u}(x,t) \\gg 1$. This is important to remember when seeking physical interpretations of results of model that include the $\\gamma_3$-term.

In the second step, the system of ordinary differential equations is solved using time-integration. This method is able to treat non-linear problems and is expected to generate reference solutions for future computations. Two variants of the method of lines are available. The first is a black-box approach that consists of using [ModelingToolkit](https://docs.sciml.ai/ModelingToolkit/stable/). The second is to build the implementation from scratch. In this latter approach, we use for the <b>spatial discretization</b> the central finite difference method on an uniform mesh with $N+1$ nodes (including left and right boundary nodes).

Then $M$ is the identify matrix and $S$ is a tridiagonal symmetric positive definite matrix. The matrix $S$ has positive diagonal entries. It therefore discretizes the term $- \\partial^2 / \\partial_x^2$ (beware of the sign).
